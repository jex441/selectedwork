## Selected-Work

This is a prototype for a dashboard for artists to upload their info and generate a custom looking website. Major website creation platforms do not cater to artists' specific needs with image galleries. Additionally they are too difficult to use. I am making an app for non technical people to quickly generate a website and have it be as easy to maintain as a social media page. Planned features are:

- Easy onboarding experience featuring drag and drop to upload, instant site generation
- Template selection
- Content organization based on artwork: Collections with pieces, each with a set of metadata and additional thumbnails
- Standard fields for artwork metadata, title, medium, dimensions, price, etc
- Custom sizing/spacing for odd sized works so that pieces are displayed with a sense of scale to the actual physical work
- Hidden collections for private links
- Analytics dashboard for user's sites
- Custom domains
- Billing portal

It uses Next.js, Vercel for hosting, UploadThing for file uploads, and Clerk for authentication. It is in a state of rapid development.
