## Selected-Work

This is a prototype for a dashboard for artists to upload their info and generate a custom looking website. Squarespace and Wix do not cater to artists' specific needs with image galleries, specifically allowing multiple images for one piece and a sensitivity to the fact that, unlike photographs, artworks are often different sizes.

I am making an app for non technical people to quickly generate a website and have it be as easy to maintain as an Instagram page. Planned features are:
- Template selection
- Hidden galleries for private links
- Custom sizing/spacing for odd sized pieces
- Multiple images for one piece, especially useful for sculptors
- Analytics dashboard for user's sites
- Custom domains

It uses Next.js and UploadThing with Clerk for authentication. It is in a state of rapid development.
