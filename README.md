## Selected Work

This is a prototype for a CMS which enables artists to upload their work and personal information. It will then generate a custom looking static website with their work.

I am making a CMS for non technical users to quickly generate a website with artist specific features and have it be as easy to maintain as a social media page.

It uses 
- Clerk for authentication
- Next.js
- Vercel
- UploadThing for file uploads
- React DND Kit for drag and drop functionality
- Drizzle ORM
- Stripe for billing
