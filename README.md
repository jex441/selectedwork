## Selected Work

This is a prototype for a CMS which enables artists to upload their work and personal information. It will then generate a custom looking static website with their work.

I am making a CMS for non technical users to quickly generate a website with artist specific features and have it be as easy to maintain as a social media page.

Features are:
- Easy onboarding experience featuring drag and drop to upload, instant site generation
- Template selection
- Content organization tailored specifically for artwork: Collections which contain pieces, each piece containing set of metadata and additional thumbnails/media
- Standard fields for artwork metadata, title, medium, dimensions, price, etc
- Customization of sizing/spacing for odd sized works so that pieces are displayed with a sense of scale to the actual physical work
- Hidden collections for private links
- Custom domains
- Billing portal

It uses 
- Clerk for authentication
- Next.js
- Vercel
- UploadThing for file uploads
- React DND Kit for drag and drop functionality
- Drizzle ORM

It is in a state of rapid development.
